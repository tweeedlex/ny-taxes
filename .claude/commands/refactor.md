Refactor the code in the following files: $ARGUMENTS
Use SOLID principles, make sure to decompose the code into smaller, reusable functions and classes.
Ensure that the code is clean, maintainable, and follows best practices.
Make sure you DO NOT change the functionality of the code, only refactor it to improve its structure and readability.

Here are some guidelines for the frontend code refactoring:
1. Break down large components into smaller, more focused components. Try to create reusable components that can be easily used across different parts of the application.
2. Use hooks to manage state and side effects in functional components. This can help to simplify the code and make it more readable.
3. When working with complex frontend components and want to ensure reusability, consider using React Compound Component Pattern.

After the refactor is complete, please provide a summary of the changes made and the benefits of the refactored code.
Additionally, include any potential areas for further improvement or optimization.
Compile the refactored code and ensure that it is working correctly without any errors.
